# Pingy
A C# programme that pings a list of IP addresses or hostnames.

Pingy will load each line of PingyAddresses.txt from your Documents directory.

Each line can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address or a domain name.

It re-pings the addresses every 20 seconds.

F5 refreshes now.

F11 opens PingyAddresses.txt in the default .txt programme.

F12 reloads the file and re-pings every address.
